        "-   Python is a popular, versatile, and easy-to-learn programming language widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and more, due to its readability, extensive libraries, and a large, supportive community.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "-  In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "-  Keywords in Python are predefined reserved words with special meanings so the interpreter can understand them. They perform specific tasks in Python programming and are a part of its syntax.25 Feb 2025\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "-  no, you cannot use keywords as variable names in most programming languages because keywords are reserved words with specific meanings, and using them as variable names would lead to syntax errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.   What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "-   In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after it's created; mutable objects can be modified, while immutable objects cannot.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "-  Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is the difference between ‚Äú==‚Äù and ‚Äúis‚Äù operators in Python ?\n",
        "-  the '==' is known as the equality operator. The 'is' is known as the identity operator. The == operator helps us compare the equality of objects. The is operator helps us check whether different variables point towards a similar object in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "-   In Python, logical operators, and, or, and not, are used to combine or manipulate boolean expressions, resulting in a single boolean value (True or False).\n",
        "\n",
        "9.   What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "-   n Python, type casting (also known as type conversion) is the process of converting a variable's data type to another, either implicitly (automatically by Python) or explicitly (using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "-    In programming, implicit type casting happens automatically by the compiler, while explicit type casting, also known as type casting, requires the programmer to explicitly instruct the conversion.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "-   Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and responsive programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.  Conditional statements in Python, like if, elif, and else, allow your code to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false, enabling dynamic and responsive programs.\n",
        "-    The if... else statement in Python is used to control the flow of execution based on a condition. It allows the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code based on whether the condition evaluates to True or False. The condition can be any expression that evaluates to either True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.   What is the difference between for and while loops  ?\n",
        "-     The main difference between for and while loops is how they determine when to stop iterating: for loops are best for iterating over a sequence or a known number of times, while while loops are used when the number of iterations is determined by a condition that must be met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "-   Use a for loop when you know the loop should execute n times. Use a while loop for reading a file into a variable. Use a while loop when asking for user input. Use a while loop when the increment value is nonstandard.25\n",
